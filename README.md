# Midterm - Coding

## Use of libraries
For each of these problems, do not use external or built-in python libraries. For example, there is a function called sum() that takes the contents of a list and returns the sum. I don't want you to use that. I want you to make your own function that does that.

Same is true for the vowel problem. Please do not use any "count the letters" functions you are able to find on the internet. You need to build a function using only the elements we have discussed in class to this point.

Thanks!

## Problem1.py

Complete the code by creating functions. The purpose of functions is to avoid duplication of code, ensure that the same code is not used twice in your overall program.

### listSum(myList)
Returns the sum (addition) total of the numbers in the list



### listMax(myList)
Returns the value of the largest element of a list

### listMin(myList)
Returns the value of the smallest element of a list


### listAverage(myList)
Returns the average value of the numbers in the list.

### listAverageDropLowest(myList)
Returns the average of a list but excludes the smallest value the list in the calculation"""


## Problem2.py
- Input is a string from the user
- Count the number of vowels in the string (A, E, I, O, U)
  - Watch out for upper/lowercase (E, e both count)
- Output results

### Sample run
```
Enter a sentence: This is my test sentence.
A: 0
E: 4
I: 2
O: 0
U: 0
```
